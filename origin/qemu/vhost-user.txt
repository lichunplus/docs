===================
1. vhost-user基于linux内核中的vhost实现，扩展一些IOCTL接口
2.它实现了同一主机上与用户空间进程建立virtqueue共享的控制面功能
3.它使用Unix域套接字上的通信来共享文件描述符
4. 协议定义通信的两端master和slave，
   master共享virtqueues 当前环境是QEMU进程
   slave是virtqueues的消费者，是一个用户空间的进程
5. master和slave和服务端、客户端并没有关联

This protocol is aiming to complement the ioctl interface used to control the
vhost implementation in the Linux kernel. It implements the control plane needed
to establish virtqueue sharing with a user space process on the same host. It
uses communication over a Unix domain socket to share file descriptors in the
ancillary data of the message.

The protocol defines 2 sides of the communication, master and slave. Master is
the application that shares its virtqueues, in our case QEMU. Slave is the
consumer of the virtqueues.

In the current implementation QEMU is the Master, and the Slave is intended to
be a software Ethernet switch running in user space, such as Snabbswitch.

Master and slave can be either a client (i.e. connecting) or server (listening)
in the socket communication.

Message Specification
---------------------
1. 字节序为本机字节序
2. vhost-user消息由3个头字段和一个有效负载组成，request+flags+size-payload
 * Request: 32-bit（目前实现23个请求类型）
 * Flags: 32-bit bit field:
   - Bit 0-1 版本好 (当前为 0x01)
   - Bit 2 回复标志（reply flag） - needs to be sent on each reply from the slave
   - Bit 3 （need reply flag）
 * Size - 32-bit size of the payload
3. 依据Request类型，payload可以是(1 of 6)：
   * A single 64-bit integer
   * A vring state description
   * A vring address description
   * Memory regions description
   * Log description
   * An IOTLB message
4. QEMU代码实现HW/virtio/vhost_user.c

   
Note that all numbers are in the machine native byte order. A vhost-user message
consists of 3 header fields and a payload:

------------------------------------
| request | flags | size | payload |
------------------------------------

 * Request: 32-bit type of the request
 * Flags: 32-bit bit field:
   - Lower 2 bits are the version (currently 0x01)
   - Bit 2 is the reply flag - needs to be sent on each reply from the slave
   - Bit 3 is the need_reply flag - see VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK for
     details.
 * Size - 32-bit size of the payload


Depending on the request type, payload can be:

 * A single 64-bit integer
   -------
   | u64 |
   -------

   u64: a 64-bit unsigned integer

 * A vring state description
   ---------------
  | index | num |
  ---------------

   Index: a 32-bit index
   Num: a 32-bit number

 * A vring address description
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   | index | flags | size | descriptor | used | available | log |
   --------------------------------------------------------------

   Index: a 32-bit vring index
   Flags: a 32-bit vring flags
   Descriptor: a 64-bit user address of the vring descriptor table
   Used: a 64-bit user address of the vring used ring
   Available: a 64-bit user address of the vring available ring
   Log: a 64-bit guest address for logging

 * Memory regions description
   ---------------------------------------------------
   | num regions | padding | region0 | ... | region7 |
   ---------------------------------------------------

   Num regions: a 32-bit number of regions
   Padding: 32-bit

   A region is:
   -----------------------------------------------------
   | guest address | size | user address | mmap offset |
   -----------------------------------------------------

   Guest address: a 64-bit guest address of the region
   Size: a 64-bit size
   User address: a 64-bit user address
   mmap offset: 64-bit offset where region starts in the mapped memory

* Log description
   ---------------------------
   | log size | log offset |
   ---------------------------
   log size: size of area used for logging
   log offset: offset from start of supplied file descriptor
       where logging starts (i.e. where guest address 0 would be logged)

 * An IOTLB message
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   | iova | size | user address | permissions flags | type |
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   IOVA: a 64-bit I/O virtual address programmed by the guest
   Size: a 64-bit size
   User address: a 64-bit user address
   Permissions: a 8-bit value:
    - 0: No access
    - 1: Read access
    - 2: Write access
    - 3: Read/Write access
   Type: a 8-bit IOTLB message type:
    - 1: IOTLB miss
    - 2: IOTLB update
    - 3: IOTLB invalidate
    - 4: IOTLB access fail

In QEMU the vhost-user message is implemented with the following struct:

typedef struct VhostUserMsg {
    VhostUserRequest request;
    uint32_t flags;
    uint32_t size;
    union {
        uint64_t u64;
        struct vhost_vring_state state;
        struct vhost_vring_addr addr;
        VhostUserMemory memory;
        VhostUserLog log;
        struct vhost_iotlb_msg iotlb;
    };
} QEMU_PACKED VhostUserMsg;

Communication
-------------
1. vhost-user基于linux内核中的vhost实现
   大多数通过Unix domain socket传递的消息都有一个等价的IOCTL实现
2. 通信由master发送请求以及slave发送应答构成，大多数请求不需要应答
3. 如果master发送消息错误或者收到错误的应答会强制关闭连接，根据配置决定是否重连
4. 扩展request都由protocol feature bits门控，这样可以向后兼容
   由于旧的slave不支持协商feature,为了兼容添加了VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES特性

The protocol for vhost-user is based on the existing implementation of vhost
for the Linux Kernel. Most messages that can be sent via the Unix domain socket
implementing vhost-user have an equivalent ioctl to the kernel implementation.

The communication consists of master sending message requests and slave sending
message replies. Most of the requests don't require replies. Here is a list of
the ones that do:

 * VHOST_USER_GET_FEATURES
 * VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES
 * VHOST_USER_GET_VRING_BASE
 * VHOST_USER_SET_LOG_BASE (if VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_LOG_SHMFD)

[ Also see the section on REPLY_ACK protocol extension. ]

There are several messages that the master sends with file descriptors passed
in the ancillary data:

 * VHOST_USER_SET_MEM_TABLE
 * VHOST_USER_SET_LOG_BASE (if VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_LOG_SHMFD)
 * VHOST_USER_SET_LOG_FD
 * VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_KICK
 * VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_CALL
 * VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ERR
 * VHOST_USER_SET_SLAVE_REQ_FD

If Master is unable to send the full message or receives a wrong reply it will
close the connection. An optional reconnection mechanism can be implemented.

Any protocol extensions are gated by protocol feature bits,
which allows full backwards compatibility on both master
and slave.
As older slaves don't support negotiating protocol features,
a feature bit was dedicated for this purpose:
#define VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES 30

Starting and stopping rings
----------------------
1. Client只能在启动后处理每个ring
2. Client只有在ring激活后才能在ring和backend传递数据
3. 如果ring已启动但是未激活，那么client只能处理不和backend交互的那些命令
4. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Client must only process each ring when it is started.

Client must only pass data between the ring and the
backend, when the ring is enabled.

If ring is started but disabled, client must process the
ring without talking to the backend.

For example, for a networking device, in the disabled state
client must not supply any new RX packets, but must process
and discard any TX packets.

If VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES has not been negotiated, the ring is initialized
in an enabled state.

If VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES has been negotiated, the ring is initialized
in a disabled state. Client must not pass data to/from the backend until ring is enabled by
VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ENABLE with parameter 1, or after it has been disabled by
VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ENABLE with parameter 0.

Each ring is initialized in a stopped state, client must not process it until
ring is started, or after it has been stopped.

Client must start ring upon receiving a kick (that is, detecting that file
descriptor is readable) on the descriptor specified by
VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_KICK, and stop ring upon receiving
VHOST_USER_GET_VRING_BASE.

While processing the rings (whether they are enabled or not), client must
support changing some configuration aspects on the fly.

Multiple queue support
----------------------
1. 多队列被视为是协议扩展，所以slave首先要实现该feature（VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_MQ）
2. slave支持的最大队列数通过VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES消息获取
3. 如果master请求的队列数量大于slave支持的数量，master应停止工作
4. 所有队列共享一个连接，在请求消息中，master使用index标识特定的队列
5. 初始阶段只会使用一个队列，协商后通过消息VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ENABLE激活多队列

Multiple queue is treated as a protocol extension, hence the slave has to
implement protocol features first. The multiple queues feature is supported
only when the protocol feature VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_MQ (bit 0) is set.

The max number of queues the slave supports can be queried with message
VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES. Master should stop when the number of
requested queues is bigger than that.

As all queues share one connection, the master uses a unique index for each
queue in the sent message to identify a specified queue. One queue pair
is enabled initially. More queues are enabled dynamically, by sending
message VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ENABLE.

Migration
---------
1. 在实时迁移期间，master可能需要跟踪从slave对内存映射区域所做的修改
2. 客户端应在日志中标记脏页
3. 

During live migration, the master may need to track the modifications
the slave makes to the memory mapped regions. The client should mark
the dirty pages in a log. Once it complies to this logging, it may
declare the VHOST_F_LOG_ALL vhost feature.

To start/stop logging of data/used ring writes, server may send messages
VHOST_USER_SET_FEATURES with VHOST_F_LOG_ALL and VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ADDR with
VHOST_VRING_F_LOG in ring's flags set to 1/0, respectively.

All the modifications to memory pointed by vring "descriptor" should
be marked. Modifications to "used" vring should be marked if
VHOST_VRING_F_LOG is part of ring's flags.

Dirty pages are of size:
#define VHOST_LOG_PAGE 0x1000

The log memory fd is provided in the ancillary data of
VHOST_USER_SET_LOG_BASE message when the slave has
VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_LOG_SHMFD protocol feature.

The size of the log is supplied as part of VhostUserMsg
which should be large enough to cover all known guest
addresses. Log starts at the supplied offset in the
supplied file descriptor.
The log covers from address 0 to the maximum of guest
regions. In pseudo-code, to mark page at "addr" as dirty:

page = addr / VHOST_LOG_PAGE
log[page / 8] |= 1 << page % 8

Where addr is the guest physical address.

Use atomic operations, as the log may be concurrently manipulated.

Note that when logging modifications to the used ring (when VHOST_VRING_F_LOG
is set for this ring), log_guest_addr should be used to calculate the log
offset: the write to first byte of the used ring is logged at this offset from
log start. Also note that this value might be outside the legal guest physical
address range (i.e. does not have to be covered by the VhostUserMemory table),
but the bit offset of the last byte of the ring must fall within
the size supplied by VhostUserLog.

VHOST_USER_SET_LOG_FD is an optional message with an eventfd in
ancillary data, it may be used to inform the master that the log has
been modified.

Once the source has finished migration, rings will be stopped by
the source. No further update must be done before rings are
restarted.

IOMMU support
-------------

When the VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM feature has been negotiated, the master
sends IOTLB entries update & invalidation by sending VHOST_USER_IOTLB_MSG
requests to the slave with a struct vhost_iotlb_msg as payload. For update
events, the iotlb payload has to be filled with the update message type (2),
the I/O virtual address, the size, the user virtual address, and the
permissions flags. Addresses and size must be within vhost memory regions set
via the VHOST_USER_SET_MEM_TABLE request. For invalidation events, the iotlb
payload has to be filled with the invalidation message type (3), the I/O virtual
address and the size. On success, the slave is expected to reply with a zero
payload, non-zero otherwise.

The slave relies on the slave communcation channel (see "Slave communication"
section below) to send IOTLB miss and access failure events, by sending
VHOST_USER_SLAVE_IOTLB_MSG requests to the master with a struct vhost_iotlb_msg
as payload. For miss events, the iotlb payload has to be filled with the miss
message type (1), the I/O virtual address and the permissions flags. For access
failure event, the iotlb payload has to be filled with the access failure
message type (4), the I/O virtual address and the permissions flags.
For synchronization purpose, the slave may rely on the reply-ack feature,
so the master may send a reply when operation is completed if the reply-ack
feature is negotiated and slaves requests a reply. For miss events, completed
operation means either master sent an update message containing the IOTLB entry
containing requested address and permission, or master sent nothing if the IOTLB
miss message is invalid (invalid IOVA or permission).

The master isn't expected to take the initiative to send IOTLB update messages,
as the slave sends IOTLB miss messages for the guest virtual memory areas it
needs to access.

Slave communication
-------------------

An optional communication channel is provided if the slave declares
VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_SLAVE_REQ protocol feature, to allow the slave to make
requests to the master.

The fd is provided via VHOST_USER_SET_SLAVE_REQ_FD ancillary data.

A slave may then send VHOST_USER_SLAVE_* messages to the master
using this fd communication channel.

 * VHOST_USER_RESET_OWNER

      Id: 4
      Master payload: N/A

      This is no longer used. Used to be sent to request disabling
      all rings, but some clients interpreted it to also discard

      Set the event file descriptor for adding buffers to the vring. It
      is passed in the ancillary data.
      Bits (0-7) of the payload contain the vring index. Bit 8 is the
      invalid FD flag. This flag is set when there is no file descriptor
      in the ancillary data. This signals that polling should be used
      instead of waiting for a kick.

      VHOST_USER_GET_FEATURES and protocol feature bit VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_RARP
      is present in VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES.
      The first 6 bytes of the payload contain the mac address of the guest to

 * VHOST_USER_NET_SET_MTU

      Id: 20
      Equivalent ioctl: N/A
      Master payload: u64

      Set host MTU value exposed to the guest.
      This request should be sent only when VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU feature has been
      successfully negotiated, VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES is present in
      VHOST_USER_GET_FEATURES and protocol feature bit
      VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_NET_MTU is present in
      VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES.
      If VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK is negotiated, slave must respond
      with zero in case the specified MTU is valid, or non-zero otherwise.

 * VHOST_USER_SET_SLAVE_REQ_FD

      Id: 21
      Equivalent ioctl: N/A
      Master payload: N/A

      Set the socket file descriptor for slave initiated requests. It is passed
      in the ancillary data.
      This request should be sent only when VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES
      has been negotiated, and protocol feature bit VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_SLAVE_REQ
      bit is present in VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES.
      If VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK is negotiated, slave must respond
      with zero for success, non-zero otherwise.

 * VHOST_USER_IOTLB_MSG

      Id: 22
      Equivalent ioctl: N/A (equivalent to VHOST_IOTLB_MSG message type)
      Master payload: struct vhost_iotlb_msg
      Slave payload: u64

      Send IOTLB messages with struct vhost_iotlb_msg as payload.
      Master sends such requests to update and invalidate entries in the device
      IOTLB. The slave has to acknowledge the request with sending zero as u64
      payload for success, non-zero otherwise.
      This request should be send only when VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM feature
      has been successfully negotiated.

 * VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_ENDIAN

      Id: 23
      Equivalent ioctl: VHOST_SET_VRING_ENDIAN
      Master payload: vring state description

      Set the endianess of a VQ for legacy devices. Little-endian is indicated
      with state.num set to 0 and big-endian is indicated with state.num set
      to 1. Other values are invalid.
      This request should be sent only when VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_CROSS_ENDIAN
      has been negotiated.
      Backends that negotiated this feature should handle both endianesses
      and expect this message once (per VQ) during device configuration
      (ie. before the master starts the VQ).

Slave message types
-------------------

 * VHOST_USER_SLAVE_IOTLB_MSG

      Id: 1
      Equivalent ioctl: N/A (equivalent to VHOST_IOTLB_MSG message type)
      Slave payload: struct vhost_iotlb_msg
      Master payload: N/A

      Send IOTLB messages with struct vhost_iotlb_msg as payload.
      Slave sends such requests to notify of an IOTLB miss, or an IOTLB
      access failure. If VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK is negotiated,
      and slave set the VHOST_USER_NEED_REPLY flag, master must respond with
      zero when operation is successfully completed, or non-zero otherwise.
      This request should be send only when VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM feature
      has been successfully negotiated.

VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK:
-------------------------------
The original vhost-user specification only demands replies for certain
commands. This differs from the vhost protocol implementation where commands
are sent over an ioctl() call and block until the client has completed.

With this protocol extension negotiated, the sender (QEMU) can set the
"need_reply" [Bit 3] flag to any command. This indicates that
the client MUST respond with a Payload VhostUserMsg indicating success or
failure. The payload should be set to zero on success or non-zero on failure,
unless the message already has an explicit reply body.

The response payload gives QEMU a deterministic indication of the result
of the command. Today, QEMU is expected to terminate the main vhost-user
loop upon receiving such errors. In future, qemu could be taught to be more
resilient for selective requests.

For the message types that already solicit a reply from the client, the
presence of VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK or need_reply bit being set brings
no behavioural change. (See the 'Communication' section for details.)
